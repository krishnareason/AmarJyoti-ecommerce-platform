A comprehensive, full-stack e-commerce web application built from scratch to serve as a digital storefront for a traditional business. AmarJyoti is designed to handle two distinct sales channels: a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) interface for individual customers and a Business-to-Business (B2B) portal for wholesalers, featuring role-based dynamic pricing and a complete admin analytics dashboard.

    * **Data-Driven Analytics:** Displays key metrics (Total Revenue, Orders, Customers) and visual charts for "Sales Over Time" and "Revenue by Customer Type".
    * **Full Product CRUD:** Admins can Create, Read, Update, and "Soft Delete" (archive) products through the UI.
    * **Centralized Order Management:** Admins can view and filter all customer orders and update their fulfillment status (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered).

* **Full Order Lifecycle:** Customers can place orders, view their complete order history with live status updates, and manage their personal profile information.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later)
* npm
* A free PostgreSQL database (e.g., from [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech))
* A free Stripe developer account for API keys.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/krishnareason/AmarJyoti-ecommerce-platform.git](https://github.com/krishnareason/AmarJyoti-ecommerce-platform.git)
    cd AmarJyoti-ecommerce-platform
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install

    JWT_SECRET="choose_a_strong_secret_key"
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."

    ```

3.  **Database Setup**
    * Connect to your PostgreSQL database.
    * Run the complete SQL script located in the project root to create all tables and seed the database with sample users, products, and orders. This will make the analytics dashboard look populated immediately.

4.  **Frontend Setup**

    npm install
    ```
    Open `client/src/pages/CartPage.js` and replace the placeholder with your Stripe Publishable Key.
