# AmarJyoti - Full-Stack Dual-Channel E-Commerce Platform

A comprehensive, full-stack e-commerce web application built from scratch to serve as a digital storefront for a traditional business. AmarJyoti is designed to handle two distinct sales channels: a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) interface for individual customers and a Business-to-Business (B2B) portal for wholesalers, featuring role-based dynamic pricing.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dual User Roles:** Separate registration and login flows for **Consumers (D2C)** and **Wholesalers (B2B)**.
* **Role-Based Dynamic Pricing:** The product catalog automatically displays different prices based on the logged-in user's role.
* **Secure Authentication:** End-to-end authentication and authorization system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and `argon2` for secure password hashing.
* **Complete Shopping Cart:** Persistent cart functionality allowing users to add, update quantities, and remove items. The cart state is saved in `localStorage`.
* **Order Placement & History:** Users can place orders, which are saved to the database. A dedicated page allows users to view their complete order history with all item details.
* **User Profile Management:** Users can view and edit their profile information (name, address, phone), with changes reflected instantly across the application.
* **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:**
    * **Protected Routes:** Only users with an 'admin' role can access the dashboard.
    * **Product Management (CRUD):** Admins can add new products to the catalog via a UI form.
    * **Centralized Order Viewing:** Admins can view a table of all orders placed by all users.
    * **Order Filtering:** The orders table can be dynamically filtered by customer role (consumer/wholesaler).
